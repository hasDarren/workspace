This.props.children:
	Let's look at a React component called Clock:
		<Clock>
			12:49 AM
		</Clock>

	No that we've implemented Clock component, we'll need to access this "12:49 AM" in order to update it.

	We can do this with children:
		<Clock>
			<Time />
			<Period />
		</Clock>
	As you might have guessed, this.props.children is an array of components rather than just a single componenet, since there are multiple components nested.
